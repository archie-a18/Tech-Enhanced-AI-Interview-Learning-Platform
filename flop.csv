"  Which is faster, python list or Numpy arrays, and why? ","NumPy arrays are faster than Python lists for numerical operations. NumPy is a library for working with arrays in Python, and it provides a number of functions for performing operations on arrays efficiently. One reason why NumPy arrays are faster than Python lists is that NumPy arrays are implemented in C, while Python lists are implemented in Python. This means that operations on NumPy arrays are implemented in a compiled language, which makes them faster than operations on Python lists, which are implemented in an interpreted language. "
  What is the difference between a python list and a tuple? ,"In Python, a list is an ordered collection of objects that can be of different types. Lists are mutable, which means that you can change the value of a list element or add or remove elements from a list. Lists are created using square brackets and a comma-separated list of values. A tuple is also an ordered collection of objects, but it is immutable, which means that you cannot change the value of a tuple element or add or remove elements from a tuple. Lists are defined using square brackets ([‘’]), while tuples are defined using parentheses ((‘’, )). Lists have several built-in methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements, while tuples do not have these methods. In general, tuples are faster than lists in Python."
  What are python sets? Explain some of the properties of sets.," In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique objects. Sets are often used to store a collection of distinct objects and to perform membership tests (i.e., to check if an object is in the set). Sets are defined using curly braces ({ and }) and a comma-separated list of values. Here are some key properties of sets in Python: Sets are unordered: Sets do not have a specific order, so you cannot index or slice them like you can with lists or tuples. Sets are unique: Sets only allow unique objects, so if you try to add a duplicate object to a set, it will not be added. Sets are mutable: You can add or remove elements from a set using the add and remove methods. Sets are not indexed: Sets do not support indexing or slicing, so you cannot access individual elements of a set using an index. Sets are not hashable: Sets are mutable, so they cannot be used as keys in dictionaries or as elements in other sets. If you need to use a mutable object as a key or an element in a set, you can use a tuple or a frozen set (an immutable version of a set). "
  What is the difference between split and join? ,"Split and join are both functions of python strings, but they are completely different when it comes to functioning. The split function is used to create a list from strings based on some delimiter, for example, space. Eg. a = ‘This is a string’ Li = a.split(‘ ‘) print(li) Output – [‘This’, ‘is’, ‘a’, ‘string’] The join() method is a built-in function of Python’s str class that concatenates a list of strings into a single string. It is called on a delimiter string and invoked with a list of strings to be joined. The delimiter string is inserted between each string in the list when the strings are concatenated. Here is an example of how to use the join() method: Eg. “ “.join(li) Output – This is a string Here the list is joined with a space in between."
  Explain the logical operations in python. ,"In Python, the logical operations and, or, and not can be used to perform boolean operations on truth values (True and False). The and operator returns True if both the operands are True, and False otherwise. The or operator returns True if either of the operands is True, and False if both operands are False. The not operator inverts the boolean value of its operand. If the operand is True, not return False, and if the operand is False, not return True."
 Explain the top 5 functions used for python strings. ,Here are the top 5 Python string functions: 
,   - len(): Returns the length of a string.
,   - strip(): Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.
,   - split(): Splits a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
,   - replace(): Replaces all occurrences of a specified string with another string.
,   - upper(): Converts a string to uppercase.
 , - lower(): Converts a string to lowercase
 What is the use of the pass keyword in python? ," pass is a null statement that does nothing. It is often used as a placeholder where a statement is required syntactically, but no action needs to be taken. For example, if you want to define a function or a class but haven’t yet decided what it should do, you can use pass as a placeholder."
 What is the use of the continue keyword in python? ,"continue is used in a loop to skip over the current iteration and move on to the next one. When continue is encountered, the current iteration of the loop is terminated, and the next one begins."
 What are immutable and mutable data types? ," In Python, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This means that you can’t change the value of an immutable object once it is created. Examples of immutable objects in Python include numbers (such as integers, floats, and complex numbers), strings, and tuples. On the other hand, a mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. This means that you can change the value of a mutable object after it is created. Examples of mutable objects in Python include lists and dictionaries. Understanding the difference between immutable and mutable objects in Python is important because it can affect how you use and manipulate data in your code. For example, if you have a list of numbers and you want to sort the list in ascending order, you can use the built-in sort() method to do this. However, if you have a tuple of numbers, you can’t use the sort() method because tuples are immutable. Instead, you would have to create a new sorted tuple from the original tuple."
  What is the use of try and accept block in python? , The try and except block in Python are used to handle exceptions. An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. The try block contains code that might cause an exception to be raised. The except block contains code that is executed if an exception is raised during the execution of the try block. Using a try-except block will save the code from an error to occur and can be executed with a message or output we want in the except block. 
 What are 2 mutable and 2 immutable data types in python? , 2 mutable data types are – Dictionary List You can change/edit the values in a python dictionary and a list. It is not necessary to make a new list which means that it satisfies the property of mutability. 2 immutable data types are: Tuples String You cannot
 What is an ordered dictionary? ,"An ordered dictionary, also known as an OrderedDict, is a subclass of the built-in Python dictionary class that maintains the order of elements in which they were added. In a regular dictionary, the order of elements is determined by the hash values of their keys, which can change over time as the dictionary grows and evolves. An ordered dictionary, on the other hand, uses a doubly linked list to remember the order of elements, so that the order of elements is preserved regardless of how the dictionary changes."
 How will you identify overfitting in a model?,Overfitting in a model occurs when the model learns the whole training data instead of taking signals/hints from the data and the model performs extremely well on training data and performs poorly on the testing data. The testing error of the model is high compared to the training error. The bias of an overfitting model is low whereas the variance is high. 
 What are the 5 assumptions for linear regression?    ,"Here are the 5 assumptions of linear regression:
  - Linearity: There is a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
  - Independence of errors: The errors (residuals) are independent of each other.
  - Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all predicted values.
  - Normality: The errors follow a normal distribution.
  - Independence of predictors: The independent variables are not correlated with each other. "
 What is Bayes’ theorem and how is it used in data science?                                                      ,"Bayes’ theorem is a mathematical formula that describes the probability of an event occurring, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In data science, Bayes’ theorem is often used in Bayesian statistics and machine learning, for tasks such as classification, prediction, and estimation."
 What is the difference between a parametric and a non-parametric test?                                            ,"A parametric test is a statistical test that assumes that the data follows a specific probability distribution, such as a normal distribution. A non-parametric test does not make any assumptions about the underlying probability distribution of the data. "
 Can you explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?  ,"Descriptive statistics is used to summarize and describe a dataset by using measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of spread (standard deviation, variance, range). Inferential statistics is used to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data and using statistical models, hypothesis testing, and estimation"

 How can we use cross-validation to overcome overfitting?                                                         ,"The cross-validation technique can be used to identify if the model is underfitting or overfitting, but it cannot be used to overcome either of the problems. We can only compare the performance of the model on two different sets of data and find if the data is overfitting or underfitting or generalized."
