# Tech-Enhanced-AI-Interview-Learning-Platform
This project introduces an advanced machine learning model designed to generate a wide range of interview questions tailored to specific topics based on an individual's resume, all while maintaining a deep level of conversation. Furthermore, we incorporate cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to analyse spoken responses, pinpointing grammatical errors, and providing precise corrections post-interview. Additionally, we employ state-of-the-art speech processing techniques, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), to assess learners' speaking pace, detect variations, and provide timely feedback for improvement. The goal of our model is to boost its adaptability and effectiveness across diverse topics and communication styles.

## OVERVIEW

-**RESUME SCANNING and CLASSIFICATION**\
-**QUESTION GENERATION**\
-**ASR and SPEECH ANALYSES**\
-**GRAMMAR CORRECTION(using API)**\
-**EVALUATION(BLEU SCORES)**

**Resume Scanning and Classification**:  User will input a pdf of his/her resume. NER is used to identify keywords based on the skills and projects mentioned in resume. Then using used Multinomial Naive Bayes, Nearest K-Neighbour Classification to classify the resumes into various job profiles.
